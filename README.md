# about this code
this is raw code, edit it as fits your system build with basic logic.<br>
this code was <b><u>intended to protect HTML files</u></b> using simple render tools.
which is usefull for UI/UX demo sites.<br>
<b> developer of this code (me), are still active developing this code, feel free to post an issue or request</b><br>
feel free to modify this code as you need :)

+ why do i even need this if its is cant hide it completely?
you know, view-source is impossible to hide! but now your dream come true! you can hide your viewsource ;)
+ for now this script can only do some trick , but i'm sure there's something else we can do with this logic in the future.
