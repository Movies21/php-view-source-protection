# php-view-source-protection
protect a view source, since f12 and right click can be disabled, so for protecting viewsource this is the way (mandalorian) haha

# about this code
this is raw code, edit it as fits your system build with basic logic.<br>
this code was <b><u>intended to protect HTML files</u></b> using simple render tools.
which is usefull for UI/UX demo sites.<br>
<b> developer of this code (me), are still active developing this code, feel free to post an issue or request</b><br>
feel free to modify this code as you need :)

+ why do i even need this if its is cant hide it completely?
you know, view-source is impossible to hide!
except for the render method. excluding it from curl or whatsoever.
and, outside it's function to trick viewsource, this script can be used as parameter management too.
<b>DEMO Parameter management SOON.</b>
+ for now this script can only do some trick, but i'm sure there's something in the future.
